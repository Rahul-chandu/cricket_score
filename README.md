The title of our project is "cricket_score" where we can update the score of a match.
The code will accumulate the score for every ball of the innings in a way of runs,wickets,wides ..etc.
We had designed the code in such way that it will display mostly all formalities  that should be taken for match like toss,displaying score ..etc.
